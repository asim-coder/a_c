the code of agreement creator


This repo is for a single page app used to create an agreement in pdf according to the user inputs.
The index.html and pdf2.php are the main files.

To deploy the app :

1. setup the local server and put these files and folders in localhost.
2.simply run index.html from your browser,give user inputs.
3.Now run pdf2.php click download agreement. 

Now the app is not fully functional but agreement can customize itself according to inputs.

There are some unwanted files and folders which i did for development.I will clean it soon!
